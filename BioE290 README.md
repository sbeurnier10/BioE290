# BioE290
A collection of Homeworks and Tutorials I completed for Berkeley's BioE290: Optimization, Statistical Models and Machine Learning for Molecular Problems
## What You'll find:
Here is all the code I wrote for BioE290 with minimal reference. I coded from scratch different Optimization Techniques & Algorithms such as SGDM and Metropolis-Monte Carlo Based Simulated Annealing, and implemented different types of PyTorch models like CNNs to improve solving classification and regression problems!
